# 1. * Ways to create a new type/class in java (class, interface, …)
     class MyClass {
     // field, constructor, and
     // method declarations
     }
 It’s simple declaration, without information about 
* superclass, interface and access level. But we can use 
* more difficult method class declaration. Example :

Public class Cat extends Animal implements Run {
// field, constructor, and
// method declarations
}

Public – access level (protected, default, privat)
Animal – superclass (cat inherit from this class)
Run – interface (implements all methods from interface Run).

In general, class declarations can include these components, in order:
Modifiers such as public, private, and a number of others that you will 
encounter later. (However, note that the private modifier can only be applied
to Nested Classes.)
The class name, with the initial letter capitalized by convention.
The name of the class's parent (superclass), if any, preceded by the keyword 
extends. A class can only extend (subclass) one parent.
A comma-separated list of interfaces implemented by the class, if any, preceded 
by the keyword implements. A class can implement more than one interface.
The class body, surrounded by braces, {}.
There are four different ways to create objects in Java with:

A. Using a new keyword is the most common way to create an object in Java applications. Almost 99% of objects are created this way.

MyObject myobject = new MyObject();
c. Using Class.forName()
If we know the name of the class and if it has a public default constructor, we can create an object this way.

Object MyObject = (Tmyobject) Class.forName("sun in.rnd.MyObject").newInstance();
C. Using clone()
A clone() can be used to create a copy of an existing object.

MyObject anotherObject = new MyObject();
MyObject myobject = (MyObject) another object.clone();
D. Deserialization of the object Usage
Deserialization of objects is nothing more than the creation of an object from its serialized form.

ObjectInputStream inStream = new ObjectInputStream(input stream);
MyObject = (MyObject) inStream.readObject() object;

#  2. *‘Inner’ classes: classification, differences, best practice.*
1. static member classes
2. non-static member classes
3. anonymous classes
4. local classes

   Nested classes are divided into two categories: non-static and static. Non-static nested classes are called inner classes. Nested classes that are declared static are called static nested classes.

Non-static nested classes (inner classes) have access to other members of the enclosing class, even if they are declared private.

As with instance methods and variables, an inner class is associated with an instance of its enclosing class and has direct access to that object's methods and fields. Also, because an inner class is associated with an instance, it cannot define any static members itself.

An instance of InnerClass can exist only within an instance of OuterClass and has direct access to the methods and fields of its enclosing instance.

An instance of InnerClass can exist only within an instance of OuterClass and has direct access to the methods and fields of its enclosing instance.
A nested class is a member of the class that includes it. Non-static nested classes (inner classes) have access to other members of the enclosing class,
even if they are declared private. Static nested classes do not have access to other members of the enclosing class. Being a member of another class, any nested class can be declared private, package private, protected or public.
To instantiate an inner class, you must first instantiate the outer class. Then, create the inner object within the outer object with this syntax:
OuterClass outerObject = new OuterClass();
OuterClass.InnerClass innerObject = outerObject.new InnerClass();
There are two special kinds of inner classes: local classes and anonymous classes.

Inner classes – exist only inside outer class. And we have  two additional options inner classes :
-local classes (has name, but exist only inside method body).
-anonymous classes (unnamed, exist only inside method body).

# 3. *A few types in one ‘java’ file: rules of usage, best practice.*
In most cases, each Java class is defined in its own *.java file. It is usually public, which means any code can call it. Interestingly, Java does not require the class to be public. You can even put two classes in the same file. When you do this, at most one of the classes in the file will be allowed to be public. If you have a public class, it must match the filename.
Public class access modifiers and class access modifiers at the default package level are the only ones that can be applied to top-level classes in a Java file. The protected and private modifiers can only be applied to inner classes. Top-level classes and interfaces can also be abstract or final.
The rules for applying class access modifiers are identical for interfaces. There can be at most one public class or interface in a Java file. Like classes, top-level interfaces can also be declared with the public or default modifiers.


#  4. *Naming convention for classes, best practice.*
Class names should be nouns, in mixed case with the first letter of each 
internal word capitalized. Try to keep your class names simple and descriptive.
Use whole words-avoid acronyms and abbreviations (unless the abbreviation is 
much more widely used than the long form, such as URL or HTML).

# 5. *Keywords to be used for creating new classes/types.*
   super - Refers to superclass (parent) objects
   abstract - A non-access modifier. Used for classes and methods: An abstract class cannot be used to create objects (to access it, it must be inherited from another class). An abstract method can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body. The body is provided by the subclass (inherited from)
   boolean, char, int, String, double, long.. – create new field.
   Public, private, protected, default – access modifier
   Class – create new class, defines a class
   Static – a non-access modifier used for methods and attributes. Static methods/attributes can be accessed without creating an object of a class.
   new - creates new objects
# 6. *Structure of a new type, possible structural elements.*
Java classes can have fields, methods, constructors, and nested types (class or interface). They can also have static initializers and instance initializers.
An enumeration can contain a field, a method, a class, an interface, a constructor, static initializers, and instance initializers.
Java interface can have constant fields (public, static, final by default), methods, and nested types. Methods can be abstract, private, default, or static. Nested types are classes or interfaces that are implicitly public and static.
#  7. *Byte code in java.*
   Bytecode in Java is an intermediate machine-independent code. It is a set of 
   instructions for Java Virtual Machine and it acts pretty similar to the assembler in C++. In general, bytecode is a code that lies between low-level and high-level language. The bytecode is not processed by the processor. It is processed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The job of the JVM is to call all the required resources to compile the Java program and make the bytecode independent. It is the biggest reason why java is known as a platform-independent language. The intermediate code can run on any of the platforms such as Windows, macOS, and Linux.
   Program: Program is a .java file. It consists of the code that you have written.
   Compiler: Compiler complies the .java file and generate .class file.
   Bytecode: The .class file contains the bytecode. Now, we can run the .class file in any of the other platforms.
   JVM: JVM runs the bytecode without considering a processor.
   Machine Code: Now, the machine generates its own machine code in which the byte code is running. That means, its own machine-dependent code to run the .java file.
   The only essential requirement for running the bytecode is the installation of basic java in any platform.
 Advantages of bytecode.
It helps in achieving the platform-independent goal with the help og butecode.
The set of insructions  for JVM may differ from the system to another but all systems can run the bytecode
Bytecode runs only when the interpreter is available
It runs on the Java virtual machine only
It gives flexible by giving a quote "Write code once, run code anywhere"
It also saves a lot of time for programmer 
It is of low cost however it gives a hight return


# 8. *Structure of a file with extension ‘.class’.*
A class file consists of a single ClassFile structure:

ClassFile {
u4             magic;
u2             minor_version;
u2             major_version;
u2             constant_pool_count;
cp_info        constant_pool[constant_pool_count-1];
u2             access_flags;
u2             this_class;
u2             super_class;
u2             interfaces_count;
u2             interfaces[interfaces_count];
u2             fields_count;
field_info     fields[fields_count];
u2             methods_count;
method_info    methods[methods_count];
u2             attributes_count;
attribute_info attributes[attributes_count];
}
The items in the ClassFile structure are as follows:

magic
The magic item supplies the magic number identifying the class file format; it has the value 0xCAFEBABE.

minor_version, major_version
The values of the minor_version and major_version items are the minor and major version numbers of this class file. Together, a major and a minor version number determine the version of the class file format. If a class file has major version number M and minor version number m, we denote the version of its class file format as M.m. Thus, class file format versions may be ordered lexicographically, for example, 1.5 < 2.0 < 2.1.

A Java Virtual Machine implementation can support a class file format of version v if and only if v lies in some contiguous range Mi.0 ≤ v ≤ Mj.m. The release level of the Java SE platform to which a Java Virtual Machine implementation conforms is responsible for determining the range.

Oracle's Java Virtual Machine implementation in JDK release 1.0.2 supports class file format versions 45.0 through 45.3 inclusive. JDK releases 1.1.* support class file format versions in the range 45.0 through 45.65535 inclusive. For k ≥ 2, JDK release 1.k supports class file format versions in the range 45.0 through 44+k.0 inclusive.

constant_pool_count
The value of the constant_pool_count item is equal to the number of entries in the constant_pool table plus one. A constant_pool index is considered valid if it is greater than zero and less than constant_pool_count, with the exception for constants of type long and double noted in §4.4.5.

constant_pool[]
The constant_pool is a table of structures (§4.4) representing various string constants, class and interface names, field names, and other constants that are referred to within the ClassFile structure and its substructures. The format of each constant_pool table entry is indicated by its first "tag" byte.

The constant_pool table is indexed from 1 to constant_pool_count-1.

access_flags
The value of the access_flags item is a mask of flags used to denote access permissions to and properties of this class or interface. The interpretation of each flag, when set, is as shown in Table 4.1.

### Table 4.1. Class access and property modifiers

*Flag Name	Value	Interpretation*
*ACC_PUBLIC	0x0001	Declared public; may be accessed from outside its package.
ACC_FINAL	0x0010	Declared final; no subclasses allowed.
ACC_SUPER	0x0020	Treat superclass methods specially when invoked by the invokespecial instruction.
ACC_INTERFACE	0x0200	Is an interface, not a class.
ACC_ABSTRACT	0x0400	Declared abstract; must not be instantiated.
ACC_SYNTHETIC	0x1000	Declared synthetic; not present in the source code.
ACC_ANNOTATION	0x2000	Declared as an annotation type.
ACC_ENUM	0x4000	Declared as an enum type.
A class may be marked with the ACC_SYNTHETIC flag to indicate that it was generated by a compiler and does not appear in source code.
The ACC_ENUM flag indicates that this class or its superclass is declared as an enumerated type.*

An interface is distinguished by its ACC_INTERFACE flag being set. If its ACC_INTERFACE flag is not set, this class file defines a class, not an interface.

If the ACC_INTERFACE flag of this class file is set, its ACC_ABSTRACT flag must also be set (JLS §9.1.1.1). Such a class file must not have its ACC_FINAL, ACC_SUPER or ACC_ENUM flags set.

An annotation type must have its ACC_ANNOTATION flag set. If the ACC_ANNOTATION flag is set, the ACC_INTERFACE flag must be set as well. If the ACC_INTERFACE flag of this class file is not set, it may have any of the other flags in Table 4.1 set, except the ACC_ANNOTATION flag. However, such a class file cannot have both its ACC_FINAL and ACC_ABSTRACT flags set (JLS §8.1.1.2).

The ACC_SUPER flag indicates which of two alternative semantics is to be expressed by the invokespecial instruction (§invokespecial) if it appears in this class. Compilers to the instruction set of the Java Virtual Machine should set the ACC_SUPER flag.

The ACC_SUPER flag exists for backward compatibility with code compiled by older compilers for the Java programming language. In Oracle’s JDK prior to release 1.0.2, the compiler generated ClassFile access_flags in which the flag now representing ACC_SUPER had no assigned meaning, and Oracle's Java Virtual Machine implementation ignored the flag if it was set.

All bits of the access_flags item not assigned in Table 4.1 are reserved for future use. They should be set to zero in generated class files and should be ignored by Java Virtual Machine implementations.

this_class
The value of the this_class item must be a valid index into the constant_pool table. The constant_pool entry at that index must be a CONSTANT_Class_info structure (§4.4.1) representing the class or interface defined by this class file.

super_class
For a class, the value of the super_class item either must be zero or must be a valid index into the constant_pool table. If the value of the super_class item is nonzero, the constant_pool entry at that index must be a CONSTANT_Class_info structure (§4.4.1) representing the direct superclass of the class defined by this class file. Neither the direct superclass nor any of its superclasses may have the ACC_FINAL flag set in the access_flags item of its ClassFile structure.

If the value of the super_class item is zero, then this class file must represent the class Object, the only class or interface without a direct superclass.

For an interface, the value of the super_class item must always be a valid index into the constant_pool table. The constant_pool entry at that index must be a CONSTANT_Class_info structure representing the class Object.

interfaces_count
The value of the interfaces_count item gives the number of direct superinterfaces of this class or interface type.

interfaces[]
Each value in the interfaces array must be a valid index into the constant_pool table. The constant_pool entry at each value of interfaces[i], where 0 ≤ i < interfaces_count, must be a CONSTANT_Class_info structure (§4.4.1) representing an interface that is a direct superinterface of this class or interface type, in the left-to-right order given in the source for the type.

fields_count
The value of the fields_count item gives the number of field_info structures in the fields table. The field_info structures (§4.5) represent all fields, both class variables and instance variables, declared by this class or interface type.

fields[]
Each value in the fields table must be a field_info (§4.5) structure giving a complete description of a field in this class or interface. The fields table includes only those fields that are declared by this class or interface. It does not include items representing fields that are inherited from superclasses or superinterfaces.

methods_count
The value of the methods_count item gives the number of method_info structures in the methods table.

methods[]
Each value in the methods table must be a method_info (§4.6) structure giving a complete description of a method in this class or interface. If neither of the ACC_NATIVE and ACC_ABSTRACT flags are set in the access_flags item of a method_info structure, the Java Virtual Machine instructions implementing the method are also supplied.

The method_info structures represent all methods declared by this class or interface type, including instance methods, class methods, instance initialization methods (§2.9), and any class or interface initialization method (§2.9). The methods table does not include items representing methods that are inherited from superclasses or superinterfaces.
attributes_count
The value of the attributes_count item gives the number of attributes (§4.7) in the attributes table of this class.
attributes[]
Each value of the attributes table must be an attribute_info (§4.7) structure.
The attributes defined by this specification as appearing in the attributes table of a ClassFile structure are the InnerClasses (§4.7.6), EnclosingMethod (§4.7.7), Synthetic (§4.7.8), Signature (§4.7.9), SourceFile (§4.7.10), SourceDebugExtension (§4.7.11), Deprecated (§4.7.15), RuntimeVisibleAnnotations (§4.7.16), RuntimeInvisibleAnnotations (§4.7.17), and BootstrapMethods (§4.7.21) attributes.
If a Java Virtual Machine implementation recognizes class files whose version number is 49.0 or above, it must recognize and correctly read Signature (§4.7.9), RuntimeVisibleAnnotations (§4.7.16), and RuntimeInvisibleAnnotations (§4.7.17) attributes found in the attributes table of a ClassFile structure of a class file whose version number is 49.0 or above.
If a Java Virtual Machine implementation recognizes class files whose version number is 51.0 or above, it must recognize and correctly read BootstrapMethods (§4.7.21) attributes found in the attributes table of a ClassFile structure of a class file whose version number is 51.0 or above.
A Java Virtual Machine implementation is required to silently ignore any or all attributes in the attributes table of a ClassFile structure that it does not recognize. Attributes not defined in this specification are not allowed to affect the semantics of the class file, but only to provide additional descriptive information (§4.7.1).

 # What access levels does a class have at the top level, i.e. an external class?
At the top level - public or package-private (without explicitly specifying a modifier).
A class can be declared with the public modifier, in which case this class is visible to all classes everywhere. If a class does not have a modifier (by default, also known as package-private), it is visible only inside its own package (packages are called groups of related classes).

# What are the members of the class?
 A class can contain members of three categories:
- Fields are variables related to the class and its objects and collectively determine the state of the class or a specific object.
- Methods (methods) – named fragments of the executable code of the class that determine the behavior of objects of the class.
- Nested classes and nested interfaces – declarations of classes or interfaces placed in the text of declarations of other classes or interfaces.

# What else can be defined in a class besides members?

1) static class initialization block;
2) instance initialization block
3) constructors.

# List the differences between the constructor and the method.
Constructor declarations look like method declarations, except that
1. They use the class name.
2. Do not have a return type.
3. Constructor declarations are not members. They are never inherited and therefore cannot be hidden or redefined.
   Additionally, the constructor differs from the method in that:
1. The constructor cannot be called directly from another method.
2. The constructor can never return a value (void methods also do not return a value).
3. The constructor is called when creating an instance of the class.
4. The constructor cannot have modifiers: abstract, static, final, native, strictfp or synchronized.

# Can the constructor have a private access level? If so, for what purposes is it necessary?
Yes, it can. This is necessary for:
1. Preventing the creation of an instance of a class from outside the declaration of this class
2. Preventing the creation of an implicit constructor

# What is the meaning of this construction?
# List the cases when the this construction is used.
In which cases it is possible to do without it, i.e. to replace it with other syntactic possibilities. If possible, how?
Answer. this is a reference to the current object.
The this construction is used:
1) To access fields overlapped by arguments of the same name or local variables of the method or constructor. You can avoid using this by using different names for class fields and local data.
2) Inside the constructor to call another constructor of the same class. This is called an explicit constructor call. In this case, you can avoid using this() only by duplicating the code.
3) To return a reference to the current object (return this). It cannot be replaced.
4) Operations with class fields inside a logical block before explicitly declaring this field are possible only when using the this reference, which is a reference to the current object.

# What does the "native" keyword mean?
 The native keyword is only applied to methods to indicate that they are implemented in platform-dependent code, usually written in another programming language such as C. The body of the native method is specified only with a semicolon, instead of a block., which indicates that the implementation is omitted.

# Why can't a static field be declared inside a method?
Because only local variables of the method are declared inside the method, which are available only inside the method. In general, only one modifier is applicable to the local variables of the method - final.
