# *1.What is the mechanism of classloading?*

The process of loading classes in Java can be divided into five stages: loading, checking, preparation, analysis and initialization. These five phases usually occur sequentially, but in the case of dynamic binding, the resolution phase occurs after the initialization phase.

1) *Download*
The main goal of the JVM at this stage is to convert byte code from various data sources (which can be class files, JAR packages, or even networks) into a binary byte stream for loading into memory and generating a class representative.java.lang.Class objects.
2) *Verification*
The JVM will check the binary byte stream at this stage, and only those that meet the JVM bytecode specifications can be executed correctly by the JVM. This stage is an important obstacle to JVM security. Here are some basic checks.
Make sure that the binary format of the byte stream matches the expected one (for example, cafe BENE from the beginning).
Whether all methods comply with the access control keyword restrictions.
Whether the number and type of method call parameters are correct.
Make sure the variables are initialized correctly before use.
Check whether the variable is assigned a value of the appropriate type.
3) *Preparation*
At this stage, the JVM will classify variables (also known as static variables, staticized keywords) allocate memory and initialize (corresponds to the initial default value for the data type, for example 0, 0L, null, false, etc.).
In other words, if there is such a piece of code:
![img_3.png](img_3.png)
the string will not be allocated memory, and strtic_string will, but the initial value of static_string is not a "static variable", but null.
should be aware of the fact that static finalmodified variables are called constants, unlike class variables. Once a constant is assigned, it will not change, so the value of final_string at the preparation stage instead of the immutable null.
4) *Resolution*
At this stage, references to symbols in the constant pool are converted to direct references.
what? A link to a symbol, a direct link?
A symbolic link is a collection of characters (literal in any form, if the target can be unambiguously located when used) to describe the specified target.
At compile time, the Java class does not know the actual address of the reference class, so only symbolic links can be used instead. For example.Wanger links to the class.The CHEM class, the Wanger class does not know the actual memory address of the Chenmo class at compile time, so only the characters can be used.Chenmo。
Direct link By resolving a symbolic link, find the actual memory address of this link.
5) *Initialization* (initialization)
This stage is the last stage in the class loading process. At the preparation stage, the initial default values were assigned to class variables, and at the initialization stage, the values expected by the code will be assigned to class variables.
The above paragraph is very abstract and difficult to understand, for example.
![img_4.png](img_4.png)
The above code uses the "new" keyword to create an instance of a string object, then at this point the constructor method of the String class will be called to create an instance of the string.


# *2.Default hierarchy of classloaders.*
The ClassLoader Delegation Hierarchy Model always functions in the order Application ClassLoader->Extension ClassLoader->Bootstrap ClassLoader. The Bootstrap ClassLoader is always given the higher priority, next is Extension ClassLoader and then Application ClassLoader.

# *3. What is the role of every element in hierarchy?*
### Application ClassLoader
The Application class loader loads the classes in a specific enabled individually deployed module or Java EE application. One instance of this class loader is present in each class loader universe; see Class Loader Universes. The Application class loader is created with a list of URLs that point to the locations of the classes it needs to load. It is parent to the Web class loader.
The Application class loader loads classes in the following order:
Classes specified by the library-directory element in the application.xml deployment descriptor or the –-libraries option during deployment; see Application-Specific Class Loading
Classes specified by the application's or module's location attribute in the domain.xml file, determined during deployment
Classes in the classpaths of the application's sub-modules
Classes in the application's or module's stubs directory
The location attribute points to domain-dir/applications/j2ee-apps/app-name or domain-dir/applications/j2ee-modules/module-name.
The stubs directory is domain-dir/generated/ejb/j2ee-apps/app-name or domain-dir/generated/ejb/j2ee-modules/module-name.

### Application ClassLoader
The Extension ClassLoader is a child of Bootstrap ClassLoader and loads the extensions of core java classes from the respective JDK Extension library. It loads files from jre/lib/ext directory or any other directory pointed by the system property java.

### Bootstrap ClassLoader
The Bootstrap class loader loads the basic runtime classes provided by the JVM, plus any classes from JAR files present in the system extensions directory. It is parent to the System class loader. To add JAR files to the system extensions, directory, see Using the Java Optional Package Mechanism.

# *4 Why don’t use only one or two classloaders?*
The reason for having three basic class loaders (Bootstrap, extension, system) is mainly security.
Prior to version 1.2 of the JVM, there was only one default class loader, which is currently called the Bootstrap class loader.
The path of classes loaded by class loaders is that each class loader first calls its parent, and if this parent does not find the requested class, the current one searches for it itself.
The key concept is the fact that the JVM will not grant access to the package (access to these methods and fields unless you specifically specified private, public or protected) if the class that requests this access comes from the same class loader that loads the class it wants to access.
So, let's assume that the user calls his java.lang.MyClass class. Theoretically, he could access packages to all fields and methods in the java.lang package and change the way they work. The language itself does not prevent this. But the JVM blocks this because all the real java.lang classes were loaded by bootstrap boot loader. Not the same bootloader = no access.
Cool loaders have other security features built in that make it difficult to perform certain types of hacking.
So, why three classes of loaders? Because they represent three levels of trust. The classes that are most trusted are the main API classes. Next, extensions are installed, and then classes that appear in the classpath, which means they are local to your machine.

# *5.Life cycle of a ‘class’ when it is loaded by classloaders.*
# *6.Stages of class construction. *

ClassLoader always follows the Delegation Hierarchy Principle.
Whenever JVM comes across a class, it checks whether that class is already loaded or not.
If the Class is already loaded in the method area then the JVM proceeds with execution.
If the class is not present in the method area then the JVM asks the Java ClassLoader Sub-System to load that particular class, then ClassLoader sub-system hands over the control to Application ClassLoader.
Application ClassLoader then delegates the request to Extension ClassLoader and the Extension ClassLoader in turn delegates the request to Bootstrap ClassLoader.
Bootstrap ClassLoader will search in the Bootstrap classpath(JDK/JRE/LIB). If the class is available then it is loaded, if not the request is delegated to Extension ClassLoader.
Extension ClassLoader searches for the class in the Extension Classpath(JDK/JRE/LIB/EXT). If the class is available then it is loaded, if not the request is delegated to the Application ClassLoader.
Application ClassLoader searches for the class in the Application Classpath. If the class is available then it is loaded, if not then a ClassNotFoundException

# *7.User-defined classloader. Why and when we need it? Best practice. *
The class loader provided by the system can only load jar packages and Class files in the specified directory. If you want to download jar packages and Class files on the network or in a file on disk D, you need to configure ClassLoader.
Implementing a custom ClassLoader requires two steps:
1. Define a custom Classloader and inherit the abstract ClassLoader class.
2. Rewrite the FindClass method and call the defineClass method in the FindClass method.
