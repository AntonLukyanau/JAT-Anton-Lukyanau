# *1.What is an Abstraction?*
Abstraction is a way to highlight a set of general characteristics of an object, excluding from consideration the particular and insignificant ones. Accordingly, an abstraction is a set of all such characteristics.

Imagine that a driver is driving in a car through a busy section of traffic. It is clear that at this moment he will not think about the chemical composition of the car's paint, the peculiarities of the interaction of gears in the gearbox or the influence of the body shape on speed (unless the car is in a dead traffic jam and the driver has absolutely nothing to do). However, he will use the steering wheel, pedals, turn signal regularly.

# *2. Maintaining/ Achieving abstraction in java, best practice.*
The maximum level of abstraction in Java is provided using interfaces. Since the interface
provides prototypes of methods, and all of them must be implemented in a class implementing the interface.
Another way to achieve abstraction is an abstract class, all of whose methods
do not have to be implemented.

Thus, the interfaces have the maximum level of abstraction.

Differences of the abstract interface class:
1. The interface describes only the behavior. He has no fortune. And an abstract class has a state: it describes both.
2. An abstract class connects and unites classes that have a very close relationship. At the same time, the same interface can be implemented by classes that have nothing in common at all.
3. Classes can implement as many interfaces as they want, but they can only be inherited from one class.
