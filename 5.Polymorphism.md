# 1. Description of the essence of the idea. #
Polymorphism is the property of a system to use objects with the same interface without information about the type and internal structure of the object.

The advantage of polymorphism is that it helps to reduce the complexity of programs by allowing the use of the same interface to specify a single set of actions. The choice of a specific action, depending on the situation, is assigned to the compiler of the programming language. Hence, the key feature of polymorphism is the use of an object of a derived class, instead of a base object (descendants can change the parent behavior, even if they are accessed by a reference of the parent type).

# 2.      What are the types of it?
In Java polymorphism is mainly divided into two types: Compile-time and Runtime.

Compile-time polymorphism is achieved by function overloading or operator overloading. (But Java does not support Operator Overloading)

Method overloading is the process that can create multiple methods of the same name in the same class, and all the methods work in different ways. Functions can be overloaded by a change in the number of arguments or/and a change in the type of arguments.

Runtime polymorphism is a process in which a function call to the overridden method is resolved at Runtime. This type of polymorphism is achieved by Method Overriding. Method overriding occurs when a derived class has a definition for one of the member functions of the base class. The base function is said to be overridden.


# 3.      Implementation and support of ‘Polymorphism’ in Java?
Polymorphism is implemented through late or dynamic binding (late binding). This means that the method is bound to the code not at the time of compilation, but at the time of program execution. The virtual machine analyzes the object on which this method is called to determine in which class to take the definition of the called method.

# 5.      Overloading and overriding methods.
An instance method in a subclass with the same signature (name, plus the number and the type of its parameters) and return type as an instance method in the superclass overrides the superclass's method.
The ability of a subclass to override a method allows a class to inherit from a superclass whose behavior is "close enough" and then to modify behavior as needed. The overriding method has the same name, number and type of parameters, and return type as the method that it overrides. An overriding method can also return a subtype of the type returned by the overridden method. This subtype is called a covariant return type.
When overriding a method, you might want to use the @Override annotation that instructs the compiler that you intend to override a method in the superclass. If, for some reason, the compiler detects that the method does not exist in one of the superclasses, then it will generate an error. For more information on @Override, see Annotations.
_____
The Java programming language supports overloading methods, and Java can distinguish between methods with different method signatures. This means that methods within a class can have the same name if they have different parameter lists (there are some qualifications to this that will be discussed in the lesson titled "Interfaces and Inheritance").
Suppose that you have a class that can use calligraphy to draw various types of data (strings, integers, and so on) and that contains a method for drawing each data type. It is cumbersome to use a new name for each method—for example, drawString, drawInteger, drawFloat, and so on. In the Java programming language, you can use the same name for all the drawing methods but pass a different argument list to each method. Thus, the data drawing class might declare four methods named draw, each of which has a different parameter list.

    public class DataArtist {
    ...
    public void draw(String s) {
    ...
    }
    public void draw(int i) {
    ...
    }
    public void draw(double f) {
    ...
    }
    public void draw(int i, double f) {
    ...
    }
    }
Overloaded methods are differentiated by the number and the type of the arguments passed into the method. In the code sample, draw(String s) and draw(int i) are distinct and unique methods because they require different argument types.
You cannot declare more than one method with the same name and the same number and type of arguments, because the compiler cannot tell them apart.

The compiler does not consider return type when differentiating methods, so you cannot declare two methods with the same signature even if they have a different return type.
# 6.      What is run time and compile time polymorphism?
There are two types of method binding in the Java language: earlier binding (also called static) and later (respectively, dynamic) binding. Calling a method in Java means that this method is bound to a specific code either at the time of compilation, or at runtime, when the program is started and objects are created.
You can understand from the name, static linking is more static in nature, since it occurs during compilation, that is, the code "knows" which method to call after compiling the Java source code into class files. And since this refers to the early stage of the program's life cycle, it is also called early binding.
On the other hand, dynamic linking occurs at runtime, after the program is started by the Java Virtual Machine. In this case, which method to call is determined by a specific object, so at the time of compilation, information is not available, because objects are created at runtime. And since this happens at a late stage of the program's life cycle, it is called late binding in the Java language.
So, the fundamental difference between static and dynamic linking in Java is that the first happens early, at compile time based on the type of the reference variable, and the second happens later, at runtime, using specific objects.
There are many differences between static and dynamic linking in Java, but the most important is how the JVM uses them. Have you ever wondered how the JVM decides which method to call if the scope contains more than one method with the same name? If you've ever used method overloading or overriding, you know that Java can have multiple methods with the same name. In the case of Java, the JVM virtual machine uses both static and dynamic binding to select the desired method.
key differences between early and late binding in Java:
Static linking occurs at compile time, and dynamic linking occurs at runtime.
Since static binding occurs at an early stage of the program lifecycle, it is called early binding. Similarly, dynamic binding is also called late binding because it occurs later, while the program is running.
Static binding is used in Java to resolve overloaded methods, while dynamic binding is used in Java to resolve overridden methods.
Similarly, private, static and terminal methods are resolved using static binding, since they cannot be overridden, and all virtual methods are resolved using dynamic binding.
In the case of static linking, not specific objects are used, but type information, that is, the type of the reference variable is used to detect the desired method. On the other hand, dynamic linking uses a specific object to find the desired method in Java.
# 7.      Polymorphism and best practice in Java.
Пpolymorphism is the ability to work with multiple types as if they are the same type. In this case, the behavior of objects will be different depending on what type they belong to.
Let's start with the first part: "the ability to work with multiple types as if they are the same type." How can different types be the same at the same time? It sounds a little strange :/
In fact, everything is simple. For example, this situation occurs with the usual use of inheritance. Let's see how it works.
Let's say we have a simple Cat parent class with a single run() method — "run":

    public class Cat {

    public void run() {
    System.out.println("Бег!");
    }
    }

And now let's create three classes that are inherited from Cat: Lion, Tiger and Cheetah, denoting lion, tiger and cheetah.

    public class Lion extends Cat {
    
    @Override
    public void run() {
    System.out.println("The lion runs at a speed of 80 km/h");
    }
    }
    
    public class Tiger extends Cat {
    
    @Override
    public void run() {
    System.out.println("The tiger runs at a speed of 60 km/h");
    }
    }
    
    public class Cheetah extends Cat {
    
    @Override
    public void run() {
    System.out.println("Cheetah runs at speeds up to 120 km/h");
    }
    }

So, we have 3 classes. Let's simulate a situation where we can work with them as if they are the same class.
Let's imagine that one of our cats is sick, and he needs the help of Dr. Aibolit. Let's try to create an Aibolit class that will be able to treat both lions, tigers, and cheetahs.

    public class Aibolit {
    
    public void healLion(Lion lion) {
    
           System.out.println("Lion healthy!");
    }
    
    public void healTiger(Tiger tiger) {
    
           System.out.println("Tiger healthy!");
    }
    
    public void healCheetah(Cheetah cheetah) {
    
           System.out.println("Chetah healthy!");
    }
    }

It would seem that the problem has been solved — the class is written and ready to work. But what will we do if we want to expand our program?
Now we have only 3 species: lions, tigers, and cheetahs. But there are more than 40 types of cats in the world. Imagine what would happen if we added separate classes to the program for manuls, jaguars, maine coons, domestic cats and everyone else.
The program itself, of course, will function, but the Aibolit class will have to constantly add new methods for treating each type of cat, and as a result it will grow to unprecedented sizes.
This is where the property of polymorphism manifests itself — "the ability to work with several types as if they were the same type." We don't need to create countless methods that will do the same thing — treat a cat.
One method will be enough for all cases at once:

    public class Aibolit {
    
    public void healCat(Cat cat) {
    
           System.out.println("Pacient healthy!");
    }
    }

In the healCat() method, we can pass both Lion, Tiger and Cheetah objects — they are all Cat:
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
    
           Aibolit aibolit = new Aibolit();
    
           Lion simba = new Lion();
           Tiger sherekhan = new Tiger();
           Cheetah chester = new Cheetah();
    
           aibolit.healCat(simba);
           aibolit.healCat(sherekhan);
           aibolit.healCat(chester);
    }
    }

This is how our Aibolit class can work with different types, as if they are the same type.
Now let's deal with the second part: "in this case, the behavior of objects will be different depending on what type they belong to."
Here, too, everything is simple. In nature, all cats run differently. At a minimum, they have different running speeds. Among our three pets, the cheetah is the fastest, and the tiger and lion run slower. That is, their behavior is different.
Polymorphism not only gives us the opportunity to use different types as one. At the same time, it also allows you not to forget about their differences and preserves behavior specific to each of them.
This can be understood by this example. Let's say, after a successful recovery, our cats decided to run a little for joy. Let's add this to our Aibolit class:
   
     public class Aibolit {
    
    public void healCat(Cat cat) {
    
           System.out.println("Pacient healthy!");
           cat.run();
    }
    }

Let's try to execute the same code for the treatment of three animals:

    public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    Aibolit aibolit = new Aibolit();
    
    Lion simba = new Lion();
    Tiger sherekhan = new Tiger();
    Cheetah chester = new Cheetah();
    
    aibolit.healCat(simba);
    aibolit.healCat(sherekhan);
    aibolit.healCat(chester);
    }

And this is what the result will look like:

The patient is healthy!
The lion runs at a speed of 80 km/h
The patient is healthy!
The tiger runs at a speed of 60 km/h
The patient is healthy!
Cheetah runs at speeds up to 120 km/h

Here we clearly see that the specific behavior of our objects has been preserved, although we have transferred all three animals to the method, "generalizing" each of them to Cat. Thanks to polymorphism, Java remembers perfectly well that these are not just three cats, namely a lion, a tiger and a cheetah that run in different ways.
This is the main advantage of using polymorphism — flexibility. When we need to create some kind of functionality common to many types, lions, tigers and cheetahs simply turn into "cats".
# 8.      Possibility to override static methods in Java.
If a subclass defines a static method with the same signature as the static method in the superclass, then the method in the subclass hides the method in the superclass.
The distinction between hiding a static method and overriding an instance method has important implications:
The version of the overridden instance method that is called is the one in the subclass.
The version of the hidden static method that is called depends on whether it is called from a superclass or a subclass.

# Is it possible to override a method in the same class? Is it possible to overload it in this class?
You cannot override a method in the same class, because the compiler will not know which of the two methods you are accessing (a compilation error is generated) - (method is already defined in class).
You can overload the method as many times as you want, because overloaded methods have a different number and/or type of parameters.
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/methods.html
# Is it possible to override a method in a subclass? Is it possible to overload it in a subclass?
A subclass can have methods with the same signature as the methods of the superclass. If the method is not static, then the subclass overrides (override) the method of the superclass.
The method in the subclass can be overloaded. If two methods of a class (both declared in the same class, or both inherited by the class, or one declared and one inherited) have the same name, but the signatures are not equivalent to redefinition, then such a method is overloaded.
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-8.html#jls-8.4.9
# How do I prevent method redefinition in a subclass? Name 2 ways.
1. Use the final modifier. The final keyword in the method declaration means that the method cannot be overridden by subclasses.
2. Use the private modifier. The private modifier indicates that an element can only be accessed in its own class.
