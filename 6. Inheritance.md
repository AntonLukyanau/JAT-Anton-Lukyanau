# 1.      What is inheritance?
A class that is derived from another class is called a subclass (also a derived class, extended class, or child class). The class from which the subclass is derived is called a superclass (also a base class or a parent class).
Excepting Object, which has no superclass, every class has one and only one direct superclass (single inheritance). In the absence of any other explicit superclass, every class is implicitly a subclass of Object.
Classes can be derived from classes that are derived from classes that are derived from classes, and so on, and ultimately derived from the topmost class, Object. Such a class is said to be descended from all the classes in the inheritance chain stretching back to Object.
The idea of inheritance is simple but powerful: When you want to create a new class and there is already a class that includes some of the code that you want, you can derive your new class from the existing class. In doing this, you can reuse the fields and methods of the existing class without having to write (and debug!) them yourself.
A subclass inherits all the members (fields, methods, and nested classes) from its superclass. Constructors are not members, so they are not inherited by subclasses, but the constructor of the superclass can be invoked from the subclass.

# 2.      Inheritance in java, supported types.
One significant difference between classes and interfaces is that classes can have fields whereas interfaces cannot. In addition, you can instantiate a class to create an object, which you cannot do with interfaces. As explained in the section What Is an Object?, an object stores its state in fields, which are defined in classes. One reason why the Java programming language does not permit you to extend more than one class is to avoid the issues of multiple inheritance of state, which is the ability to inherit fields from multiple classes. For example, suppose that you are able to define a new class that extends multiple classes. When you create an object by instantiating that class, that object will inherit fields from all of the class's superclasses. What if methods or constructors from different superclasses instantiate the same field? Which method or constructor will take precedence? Because interfaces do not contain fields, you do not have to worry about problems that result from multiple inheritance of state.
Multiple inheritance of implementation is the ability to inherit method definitions from multiple classes. Problems arise with this type of multiple inheritance, such as name conflicts and ambiguity. When compilers of programming languages that support this type of multiple inheritance encounter superclasses that contain methods with the same name, they sometimes cannot determine which member or method to access or invoke. In addition, a programmer can unwittingly introduce a name conflict by adding a new method to a superclass. Default methods introduce one form of multiple inheritance of implementation. A class can implement more than one interface, which can contain default methods that have the same name. The Java compiler provides some rules to determine which default method a particular class uses.
The Java programming language supports multiple inheritance of type, which is the ability of a class to implement more than one interface. An object can have multiple types: the type of its own class and the types of all the interfaces that the class implements. This means that if a variable is declared to be the type of an interface, then its value can reference any object that is instantiated from any class that implements the interface. This is discussed in the section Using an Interface as a Type.
As with multiple inheritance of implementation, a class can inherit different implementations of a method defined (as default or static) in the interfaces that it extends. In this case, the compiler or the user must decide which one to use.

# 3.      Ways to use inheritance in java.
The most important use of inheritance in Java is code reusability. The code that is present in the parent class can be directly used by the child class. Method overriding is also known as runtime polymorphism. Hence, we can achieve Polymorphism in Java with the help of inheritance.

# 4.      Difference between inheritance and abstraction.
Abstraction hides implementation details and only shows functionality. This reduces the complexity of the code. Inheritance creates a class using the properties of another class. This improves code reusability.


# 5.  Polymorphism and inheritance differences.
Inheritance is the mechanism of allowing a new class to use properties and methods of a superclass while polymorphism is the ability of an object to behave in multiple ways (lets you call methods of a class without knowing the exact type of the class).


# 6.      Composition vs inheritance.
Despite the fact that both composition and inheritance allow code to be reused, they do it in different ways. The main difference between them is that the composition allows you to reuse the code without expanding it. Inheritance in this case requires an extension of the existing class. Another important difference is that when composing, we can reuse code even from the final class, whereas it is impossible to inherit from it. In addition, when composing, it is possible to use code from several different classes. This trick won't work with inheritance: Java doesn't support multiple inheritance

Flexibility
The first difference concerns the flexibility of the code. When using inheritance, you should describe which class you are extending. At the same time, you cannot replace it during the execution of the program. Using composition, you can define the type used, which can contain several different implementations. Thus, composition provides much more flexibility than inheritance.

Limited code reuse in inheritance
As already mentioned, it is possible to inherit in Java from only one class, which means that one and only one class can be reused. If you want to get the functionality of several classes, then you should use composition. Eg: your code must use authentication, therefore you need to inherit the Authenticator class, Autorizer to use authorization, etc. But since multiple inheritance is not supported in Java, you cannot do this. The only way out is composition.

Unit tests
An important argument when choosing how to reuse code is that classes extended with composition are easier to test, since you can always provide a stub for the class being used. When inheriting, you will need a parent class for testing, and you will not be able to replace it with a stub.

Final classes
The inability to extend final classes is another limitation of inheritance. In Java, there is no way to inherit from final classes, so again the only way out is to use composition to reuse code.

Encapsulation
The last difference between composition and inheritance in Java is their relation to encapsulation. Despite the fact that both techniques allow code reuse, inheritance violates the principle of encapsulation, since the subclass depends on the behavior of the parent class. If the parent class changes its behavior, it will affect its descendants as well. If the classes are poorly documented and the descendant class does not use the parent correctly, then any change to the parent will break the functionality of the descendant. To see this with an example, you can read chapters 16 and 17 of Effective Java.

# Which class is the parent for all classes?
The Object class in the java.lang package is located at the top of the class hierarchy tree. Each class is a descendant, direct or indirect, of the Object class. Each class inherits the methods of an Object instance.

# Which class is the parent for all enumerations?

All enumerations are inherited from the java.lang class.Enum, which in turn is inherited by java.lang.Object
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Enum.html

# Which interface is the parent for all interfaces?
There is no common "root" interface implicitly inherited by all interfaces, as is the case with classes. Interfaces are not inherited from Object.
What may seem surprising is that it is still possible to call Object methods (such as toString, hashCode, etc.) even for interface types.
