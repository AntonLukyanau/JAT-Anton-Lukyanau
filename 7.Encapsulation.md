# 1.      What is encapsulation?
Encapsulation describes the ability of an object to hide its data and methods from the rest of the world and is one of the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming. In Java, a class encapsulates the fields, which hold the state of an object, and the methods, which define the actions of the object. Encapsulation enables you to write reusable programs. It also enables you to restrict access only to those features of an object that are declared public. All other fields and methods are private and can be used for internal object processing.

# 3.      Advantages of encapsulation.
Control over the correct state of the object. Examples of this were above: thanks to the setter and the private modifier, we secured our program from cats with a weight of 0.

User-friendliness due to the interface. We leave "outside" for user access only methods. It is enough for him to call them to get a result, and he does not need to delve into the details of their work at all.

Changes in the code do not affect users. We make all changes inside the methods. This will not affect the user: he wrote auto.gas() for the gas of the car, and he will write. And the fact that we have changed something in the work of the gas() method will remain unnoticeable for him: he, as before, will simply get the desired result.

# 4.      Support encapsulation in java, how to achieve, benefits of using.
1. hiding the implementation.
How is it that we use all sorts of complex mechanisms without understanding how they work and what their work is based on? It's simple: their creators have provided a simple and user-friendly interface.

On the soda machine, the interface is the buttons on the panel. By pressing one button, you select the volume of the glass. By pressing the second one, you select the syrup. The third is responsible for adding ice. And that's all you have to do.

It doesn't matter how exactly the machine is arranged inside. The main thing is that it is designed in such a way that the user needs to press three buttons to get a soda.

It's the same with the car. It doesn't matter what's going on inside him. The main thing is that when the right pedal is pressed, the car goes forward, and when the left pedal is pressed, it brakes.

This is the essence of concealment. All the "insides" of the program are hidden from the user. For him, this information is superfluous, unnecessary. The user needs an end result, not an internal process.


2. hiding the data
For example, we have a Cat class:


    public class Cat {
    
    public String name;
    public int age;
    public int weight;
    
    public Cat(String name, int age, int weight) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    this.weight = weight;
    }
    
    public Cat() {
    }
    
    public void sayMeow() {
    System.out.println("Meow!");
    }
    }
The problem is that his data (fields) are open to everyone, and another programmer can easily create an unnamed cat in the program with a weight of 0 and an age of -1000 years:
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    Cat cat = new Cat();
    cat.name = "";
    cat.age = -1000;
    cat.weight = 0;
    
    }

In such a situation, you can closely monitor whether one of your colleagues creates objects with an incorrect state, but it would be much better to exclude the very possibility of creating such "incorrect objects".

With the concealment of data, they help us:

access modifiers (private, protected, package default);
getters and setters.

# 5.      Difference between inheritance and encapsulation.
Inheritance is an object oriented concept which creates a parent-child relationship. It is one of the ways to reuse the code written for parent class but it also forms the basis of Polymorphism.

Encapsulation is an object oriented concept which is used to hide the internal details of a class, for example, HashMap encapsulate how it store elements and calculate hash values.
