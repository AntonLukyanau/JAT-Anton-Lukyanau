# 1.      What is interface?
The interface keyword is used to create completely abstract classes. The main purpose of the interface is to determine how we can use the class that implements it. The interface creator defines method names, argument lists, and return value types, but does not implement their behavior. All methods are implicitly declared as public.
Starting with Java 8, interfaces are allowed to place the implementation of default methods and static static methods.
The interface can also contain fields. In this case, they are automatically public public, static static and immutable final.
# 2.      Interface in Java


# 3.      Multiple inheritance and interface.
In Java, multiple inheritance is not supported in classes, but it is supported in interfaces. And one interface can extend many other interfaces. Below is a simple example.

    com package.journaldev.inheritance;
    public interface InterfaceA {
    public void doSomething();
    }
    com package.journaldev.inheritance;
    public interface InterfaceB {
    public void doSomething();
    }

Note that both interfaces declare the same method. Now we can create an interface that extends both of these interfaces, as shown in the example below.

    com package.journaldev.inheritance;
    open interface InterfaceC extends InterfaceA, InterfaceB {
    //the same method is declared in InterfaceA and InterfaceB as
    public void doSomething();
    }

This works great because interfaces only declare methods, and the implementation will be done in classes inheriting the interface. Thus, there is no way to get ambiguity in multiple inheritance of interfaces.

    com package.journaldev.inheritance;
     class InterfacesImpl implements InterfaceA, InterfaceB, InterfaceC {
    @Redefine
    public void doSomething() {
    System.out.println("doSomething implementation of a specific class");
    }
    public static void main(string[] arguments) {
    Interface objA = new interface simpl();
    InterfaceB objB = new interface simpl();
    Interface ObjC = new interface simpl();
    
    //all of the method calls below refer to the same specific implementation
    objA.doSomething();
    objB.doSomething();
    ObjC.doSomething();
    }
    }

Note that every time you redefine any superclass method or implement an interface method, use the @Redefine annotation.

What if we want to use the function that and methodA(), class class and function methodB(), class, then in ClassC class? The solution lies in the use of composition. Below is a version of the ClassC class that uses composition to define both class methods and the doSomething() method, one of the objects.

    com package.journaldev.inheritance;
    public class ClassC{
     ClassA objA = new ClassA();
     ClassB objB = new ClassB();
             public invalidity test(){
             objA.doSomething();
    }
    public void method(){
     Object.Method();
    }
    public void methodB(){
     objB.methodB();
    }
    }

# 4.      Possible content of an interface in java.
Constants (public static final variables), public abstract methods, public static methods, public default methods, private methods, static private methods, public static inner classes, public static inner interfaces.

# 5.      Object class and interfaces.
There is no common "root" interface implicitly inherited by all interfaces, as is the case with classes. Interfaces are not inherited from Object.
What may seem surprising is that it is still possible to call Object methods (such as toString, hashCode, etc.) even for interface types.


# 6.      Marker or tagged interfaces.
A marker interface is an interface that has no methods or constants inside it. It provides run-time type information about objects, so the compiler and JVM have additional information about the object. A marker interface is also called a tagging interface.
An example is the Cloneable interface, which indicates that the class supports the cloning mechanism.

# 7.      Differences between interface and abstract class.
In Java, a class can implement multiple interfaces at the same time, but inherit from only one class.
Abstract classes are used only when the relationship type "is a" (is) is present. Interfaces can be implemented by classes that are not related to each other.
An abstract class is a means to avoid writing repetitive code, a tool for partially implementing behavior. An interface is a means of expressing the semantics of a class, a contract describing capabilities. All interface methods are implicitly declared as public abstract or (since Java 8) default methods with default implementation, and fields are public static final.
Interfaces allow you to create type structures without hierarchy.
Inheriting from the abstract, the class "dissolves" its own individuality. By implementing the interface, it extends its own functionality.
Abstract classes contain a partial implementation, which is supplemented or extended in subclasses. At the same time, all subclasses are similar to each other in terms of the implementation inherited from the abstract class, and differ only in terms of their own implementation of the abstract methods of the parent. Therefore, abstract classes are used in the case of building a hierarchy of the same type, very similar to each other classes. In this case, inheriting from an abstract class that implements the default behavior of an object can be useful, as it avoids writing repetitive code. In all other cases, it is better to use interfaces.

# 8.      Interface in java 1.8 and java 1.9 .: new features (YH)
### Методы интерфейсов по умолчанию;
Default interface methods;
The interface can include as many default methods as you want and still remain functional, because default methods are not abstract.
ava 8 allows you to add non-abstract implementations of methods to the interface using the default keyword:

    interface Example {
    int process(int a);
    default void show() {
    System.out.println("default show()");
    }
    }
If a class implements an interface, it can, but is not required to, implement default methods already implemented in the interface. The class inherits the default implementation.
If a certain class implements several interfaces that have the same default method, then the class must implement the method with the matching signature on its own. The situation is similar if one interface has a default method, and in another the same method is abstract - no default implementation is inherited by the class.
The default method cannot override the method of the java.lang.Object class.
They help implement interfaces without fear of disrupting the work of other classes.
They allow you to avoid creating utility classes, since all the necessary methods can be represented in the interfaces themselves.
Give freedom to classes to choose the method that needs to be redefined.
One of the main reasons for implementing default methods is the ability of collections in Java 8 to use lambda expressions.
What is a static interface method?
Static interface methods are similar to the default methods, except that they cannot be overridden in classes that implement the interface.

Static methods in the interface are part of the interface without the ability to override them for objects of the implementation class;
Methods of the java.lang.Object class cannot be overridden as static;
Static methods in the interface are used to provide auxiliary methods, for example, checking for null, sorting collections, etc.
### Lambda expressions;
The lambda expression does not execute by itself, but forms an implementation of the method defined in the functional interface. It is important that the functional interface should contain only one single method without implementation.
### Functional interfaces;
A functional interface is an interface that defines only one abstract method.
To accurately define the interface as functional, an annotation @FunctionalInterface has been added, working on the principle of @Override. It will indicate the intent and will not allow you to define a second abstract method in the interface.

# 9.      Interface and inner classes.
Java inner class or nested class is a class that is declared inside the class or interface. We use inner classes to logically group classes and interfaces in one place to be more readable and maintainable. Additionally, it can access all the members of the outer class, including private data members and methods.


# Why can't I declare an interface method with the final modifier?
In the case of interfaces, specifying the final modifier is meaningless, because all interface methods are implicitly declared as abstract, i.e. they cannot be executed without implementing somewhere else, and this cannot be done if the method has the final identifier.
