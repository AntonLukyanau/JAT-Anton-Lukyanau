## 1.	What is collection framework and talk about its hierarchy.
 The Java collections framework gives the programmer access to 	prepackaged data structures as well as to algorithms for manipulating them. 	for example, Java Collections can achieve all the operations that you perform 	 on data such as searching, sorting, insertion, manipulation, and deletion.
For Hierarchy Review this article: https://www.javatpoint.com/collections-	in-java

## 2.	What are lists? What are subclasses for lists?
In Java, a list interface is an ordered collection of objects in which 		    duplicate values can be stored.
subclasses: arraylist, LinkedList, vector, stack.

## 3.	What are legacy classes?
   Legacy classes and interfaces are the classes and interfaces that 	formed the collections framework in the earlier versions of Java and how 	now been restructured or re-engineered. They are fully compatible with the 	framework. Formally they are not deprecated.

Deprecated methods are methods that used to be supported and safe to use, 	but no longer are safe to use.


## 4.	How many ways can we instantiate Array Lists?
Initialization with add

ArrayList<Type> str = new ArrayList<Type>();
str.add("Geeks");
str.add("for");
str.add("Geeks");

using aslist

ArrayList<Type> obj = new ArrayList<Type>(
Arrays.asList(Obj A, Obj B, Obj C, ....so on));

using listof

List<Type> obj = new ArrayList<>(
List.of(Obj A, Obj B, Obj C, ....so on));

create another collection

List<Integer> arr = new ArrayList<>();
arr.add(1);

## 5.	How does Array List capacity work?
The ArrayList size increases dynamically because whenever the 	ArrayList class requires to resize then it will create a new array of bigger 	size and copies all the elements from the old array to the new array.

In Java 8 and later the new capacity is calculated which is 50% more than 	the old capacity and the array are increased by that capacity.

## 6.	Array List vs Array
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/array-vs-arraylist-in-java/
## 7.	Can we store primitives in Array Lists?
Primitive data types cannot be stored in ArrayList but can be in 	Array. Array List is a kind of List and List implements Collection interface

It stores objects, generic types

## 8.	Talk about wrapper classes
A Wrapper class is a class whose object wraps or contains primitive 	data types. When we create an object to a wrapper class, it contains a field 	and in this field, we can store primitive data types. In other words, we can 	wrap a primitive value into a wrapper class object.

Example: Integer, Float, Boolean

wrapper objects are object representation of primitive types

String No. String is not a wrapper class, simply because there is no parallel 	primitive type that it wraps
 9.	What are genetics?
Answer: Java Generic methods and generic classes enable programmers to 	specify, with a single method declaration, a set of related methods, or with a 	single class declaration, a set of related types, respectively. Generics also 	provide compile-time type safety that allows programmers to catch invalid 	types at compile time. Stronger type checks at compile time. A Java 		compiler applies strong type checking to generic code and issues errors if the 	code violates type safety

## 10.	 How are elements moved from one Array list to another?


## 11.	 In which case would you use array list over linked list?
     
## 12.	 Difference between list and set?
List is a type of ordered collection that maintains the elements in insertion 	order while Set is a type of unordered collection so elements are not 		maintained any order. List allows duplicates while Set doesn't allow 		duplicate elements.
## 13.	 How to compare two array lists if they are equal?
equals() is the method used for comparing two Array List. It compares the 	Array lists as, both Array lists should have the same size, and all 		corresponding pairs of elements in the two Array lists are equal.

R
## 14.	 What is the equal method and which class does it belong to?
    So, equals method is in object class, and it compares two objects if 	they are equal or not.

## 15.	Do array list override equals method?
    
       If you check sources of ArrayList, you will see that it calls equals of other object. In your case it will call equals of String "UNIQUE ID1" which will check that other object is not of type String and just returns false:
    

## 16.	What is split iterator?
    Split iterator is introduced in Java 8 for achieving parallelism. It can split the given set of elements and can perform operations parallelly using different independent threads. It can traverse the elements parallelly as well as sequentially manner.


## 17.	 How to iterate Hash Map?
    
## 18.	 On what are we calling .next Method when we iterate on HashMap?
        Answer:

// using iterators
Iterator<Map.Entry<String, String>> itr = gfg.entrySet().iterator();

        while(itr.hasNext())
        {
             Map.Entry<String, String> entry = itr.next();
             System.out.println("Key = " + entry.getKey() +
                                 ", Value = " + entry.getValue());
        }

answer is calling on iterator
## 19.	 What is enhanced for loop?
       
In Java, the for-each loop is used to iterate through elements of arrays and collections (like ArrayList). It is also known as the enhanced for loop.
It's simply For Each loop.

## 20.	What is entry set?

entrySet() method in Java is used to create a set out of the same elements contained in the hash map. It basically returns a set view of the hash map, or we can create a new set and store the map elements into them.



## 21.	 How to filter array list using functional interface?
The Predicate functional interface is a specialization of a Function that 	receives a generified value and returns a boolean. A typical use case of the 	Predicate lambda is to filter a collection of values:
## 22.	 Can I convert list to set using streams?

List<Integer> mylist = Arrays.asList(100, 101, 102);
Set<Integer> myset = mylist.stream().collect(Collectors.toSet()));
So yeah, we can
## 23.	 Short description of what stream Api is?
        Introduced in Java 8, the Stream API is used to process collections of objects. A stream is a sequence of objects that supports various methods which can be pipelined to produce the desired result.
## 24.	Time complexity of each collection
     

## 25.	What examples of set you know?
HashSet is an unordered & unsorted collection of the data set, whereas the LinkedHashSet is an ordered and sorted collection of HashSet. HashSet does not provide any method to maintain the insertion order. Comparatively, LinkedHashSet maintains the insertion order of the elements.

TreeSet

## 26.	 I want to have unique elements and order what should I use?
treeset will never save order of elements, linkedHash set is answer
A TreeSet is a set where the elements are sorted. A HashSet is a set were 	the elements are not sorted or ordered. It is faster than a TreeSet. The 		HashSet is an implementation of a Set.

## 27.	 difference between hasset and linked hasset. Have you used a tree set? How can we create a tree set for anyclass? u have a class and u want to implelemnt tree set. What should u use? implement what? i want to write muliple treesets (different). different comperators for different treeSets

HashSet is an unordered & unsorted collection of the data set, whereas the 	LinkedHashSet is an ordered and sorted collection of HashSet. HashSet 	does not provide any method to maintain the insertion order. Comparatively, 	LinkedHashSet maintains the insertion order of the elements.

The elements in TreeSet must be of a Comparable type. String and Wrapper 	classes are Comparable by default. To add user-defined objects in TreeSet, 	you need to implement the Comparable interface.

## 28. 	how null is walking in our sets? do all sets allow null value? what will happen null 	in hashset linked hashet? What will happen to its order? in which place we will 	find our null for hashset it will be 0? for linked has set will it be 0 or what?
      
As per the definition a set object does not allow duplicate values, but it does allow 	at most one null value. Null values in HashSet âˆ’ The HashSet object allows null 	values but, you can add only one null element to it. Though you add more null 	values if you try to print its contents, it displays only one null.

## 29. 	How Hash set works inside? what will be key and value in haset if it's based on 	hashmap ()

HashSet internally uses HashMap to store its elements. Whenever you create a 	HashSet object, one HashMap object associated with it is also created. This 	The HashMap object is used to store the elements you enter in the HashSet. The 	elements you add into HashSet are stored as keys of this HashMap object.

## 30. 	How does HashMap work inside? If the bucket is not empty what will be going 	on? (i think we will have a collision, if we add same element each time what 	will happen with the same keys? The old one will be replaced, but why? if we 	have collision) how collision is solved in HashMap

HashMap uses its static inner class Node<K,V> for storing map entries. That 	means each entry in hashMap is a Node . Internally HashMap uses a 			hashCode of the key Object and this hashCode is further used by the hash 		function to find the index of the bucket where the new entry can be added.

1) HashMap handles collision by using a linked list to store map entries ending up in same array location or bucket location. 2) From Java 8 onwards, HashMap, Concurrent HashMap, and Linked HashMap will use the balanced tree in place of linked list to handle frequent hash collisions


## 31. 	could you please tell me how list queue can be iterated? (List iterator and 	iterator I think)
